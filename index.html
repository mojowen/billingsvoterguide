Beyond that, the City Council is not the right place to determine discrimination laws. The state and federal levels are where those difficult decisions need to take place.Programs and Services

                                We should cooperate with the County in these programs. We also need to encourage funding for the expanded treatment services and facilities that are necessary to a successful diversification program.

                                It is an expensive program that keeps low-risk offenders unnecessarily sitting in jail -- and that expense is passed onto the taxpayers. Diversion program -- yes. If it is implemented wisely, recidivism goes down, the cost is much less, and the offender takes on most of the financial responsibility -- not the taxpayer.

                                These amenities will make the City more attractive and desirable to current and future residents, and promote healthy lifestyles.  Billings has been somewhat late to realize the benefit of  these facilities and therefore needs to address methods of eliminating certain obstacles and situations that hinder a complete bike and trail system.

                                Limiting boundaries might be more involved than what is seen on the surface. With a change in tax structure Laurel and Lockwood could expand their boundaries and Billings would be left with stagnate growth potential. If you are thinking along the lines of infill areas this can also be complicated. First someone would want to sell property, then a developer would need to take the risk to develop, and then someone would want to live in the area.

Passing ordinances or laws can't be taken lightly once passed they have to be enforced. A good example of a good intentioned ordinance, the cell phone ban in City limits, with failed enforcement.

                                I really think Billings has more essential issues to work on. If trails and bike lanes are built using grant monies, the on going maintenance costs money and has to come from some where. Maybe bikers should have a license fee to help with the cost. Don't get me wrong, I think trails and bike lanes are great if resources were unlimited.

                                The City Council cannot control subdivision growth outside the city limits. However, it is important that if subdivisions are annexed into the city, the subdivisions must pay appropriate impact fees that ensure the taxpayers of Billings arenâ€™t footing the bill for infrastructure. Appropriate impact fees for annexation naturally make infill areas cost competitive for redevelopment, which, in turn, helps increase the tax base without expanding the service area.

                                Billings should work to limit the amount of sprawl. Expanding our boundaries via annexation increases the associated cost of delivery of city services to these areas. While growth will continue in Billings, it needs to be sustainable and efficient and not be an excessive burden to taxpayers.
