Billings has been somewhat late to realize the benefit of  these facilities and therefore needs to address methods of eliminating certain obstacles and situations that hinder a complete bike and trail system.","name":"Brent Cromley","photo":"/images/counselors/Cromley.Brent.jpg"},{"ward":"1","first name":"Kerri","last name":"Seekins-Crowe","website":"http://www.kerriforcouncil.com/?fb_ref=Default","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/KerriforCouncil15","twitter":"","phone number":"245-0430 (h), 208-6587 (w)","email address":"kerricrowe66@gmail.com","why":"City Council's focus needs to be rebuilding trust, finding smart solutions for safety and services, implementing fiscal responsibility, and aiding the economic growth of the city.","work to limit city expansion boundaries?":"Yes","work to limit city expansion boundaries?--moreinfo":"Growth is great if it's done right.

Beyond that, the City Council is not the right place to determine discrimination laws.

If it is implemented wisely, recidivism goes down, the cost is much less, and the offender takes on most of the financial responsibility -- not the taxpayer.","expand the multi-use trail and bike lanes?":"No","expand the multi-use trail and bike lanes?--moreinfo":"I am glad that there is a phenomenal trail system in the Heights. I, and 100s of others, use it daily.

With a change in tax structure Laurel and Lockwood could expand their boundaries and Billings would be left with stagnate growth potential. If you are thinking along the lines of infill areas this can also be complicated. First someone would want to sell property, then a developer would need to take the risk to develop, and then someone would want to live in the area.","pass a fully inclusive non discrimination ordinance?":"No","pass a fully inclusive non discrimination ordinance?--moreinfo":"I do not believe that the City of Billings should be passing laws for special interest groups, where do you start and stop. Passing ordinances or laws can't be taken lightly once passed they have to be enforced.

If trails and bike lanes are built using grant monies, the on going maintenance costs money and has to come from some where. Maybe bikers should have a license fee to help with the cost.

However, it is important that if subdivisions are annexed into the city, the subdivisions must pay appropriate impact fees that ensure the taxpayers of Billings aren’t footing the bill for infrastructure. Appropriate impact fees for annexation naturally make infill areas cost competitive for redevelopment, which, in turn, helps increase the tax base without expanding the service area.","pass a fully inclusive non discrimination ordinance?":"No","pass a fully inclusive non discrimination ordinance?--moreinfo":"I believe that the State and Federal governments are best suited to legislate and execute discrimination laws.
