During my first term on the Council, this has been a top priority of mine in land use decisions.",Yes,"Besides being an issue of human rights, this is also needed in order for our City to compete with other cities in attracting businesses and functions which are now bypassing us in favor of more welcome venues.",Yes,We should cooperate with the County in these programs. We also need to encourage funding for the expanded treatment services and facilities that are necessary to a successful diversification program.,Yes,"These amenities will make the City more attractive and desirable to current and future residents, and promote healthy lifestyles.  Billings has been somewhat late to realize the benefit of  these facilities and therefore needs to address methods of eliminating certain obstacles and situations that hinder a complete bike and trail system."

Sprawl is costing residents and the city in ways that a good plan would have prevented.,No,"For any entity that contracts with the city, the City Council should remove any policies that discriminate in the following areas: -- Housing, City Employment, City Contracting, Boards and Commissions, and Federal Title VI City. Beyond that, the City Council is not the right place to determine discrimination laws. The state and federal levels are where those difficult decisions need to take place.Programs and Services",No,"It is an expensive program that keeps low-risk offenders unnecessarily sitting in jail -- and that expense is passed onto the taxpayers. Diversion program -- yes. If it is implemented wisely, recidivism goes down, the cost is much less, and the offender takes on most of the financial responsibility -- not the taxpayer.",No,"I am glad that there is a phenomenal trail system in the Heights. I, and 100s of others, use it daily. However, bike paths and trails need to be constructed in a responsible manner that adds to the beauty of this city -- not creates congestion."
2,Larry,Brewster,,,,670-0929,larry05@bresnan.net,"keep costs down, responsible development, good transportation, better parks. lower water rates, finish inner belt loop.",No,"If there is property adjacent to the boundary and the developer pay's for improvements, it's better than low density development.",No,"Depends on the ordinance, I support the principal if it protects a persons right to exercise conscience.",Yes,"I'm all for that, better on probation than jail.",Yes,"I especially like them in commute corridors, another motivation to ride."
2,Frank ,Ewalt ,,,,245-3671,fewalt@gmail.com ,,Maybe,"Limiting boundaries might be more involved than what is seen on the surface. With a change in tax structure Laurel and Lockwood could expand their boundaries and Billings would be left with stagnate growth potential. If you are thinking along the lines of infill areas this can also be complicated. First someone would want to sell property, then a developer would need to take the risk to develop, and then someone would want to live in the area.",No,"I do not believe that the City of Billings should be passing laws for special interest groups, where do you start and stop. Passing ordinances or laws can't be taken lightly once passed they have to be enforced. A good example of a good intentioned ordinance, the cell phone ban in City limits, with failed enforcement.",Unsure,I do not know enough about this subject to comment wisely.,No,"I really think Billings has more essential issues to work on. If trails and bike lanes are built using grant monies, the on going maintenance costs money and has to come from some where. Maybe bikers should have a license fee to help with the cost. Don't get me wrong, I think trails and bike lanes are great if resources were unlimited."

Parks, public safety, jobs, smart growth, community pride. Respect for people and continuing to become more open, tolerant and inclusive. Protect our water, reduce waste, and reuse and recycle what we can.",Yes,"Billings needs to hold fast to its commitment to infill, expand infrastructure in a smart and efficient manner. The city should move away from a sprawl tradition and grow in a way that enhances the city’s athletics and resources.",Yes,Without Question.,Yes,Opportunity not incarceration. Let’s drop the practice of making problems worse and ultimately more expensive.,Yes,There should be full and inclusive connectivity throughout Billings when the system is complete.

However, it is important that if subdivisions are annexed into the city, the subdivisions must pay appropriate impact fees that ensure the taxpayers of Billings aren’t footing the bill for infrastructure. Appropriate impact fees for annexation naturally make infill areas cost competitive for redevelopment, which, in turn, helps increase the tax base without expanding the service area.",No,I believe that the State and Federal governments are best suited to legislate and execute discrimination laws. A local NDO adds to the patchwork LGBT laws throughout the state and country and provides limited remedies to employment and housing discrimination.,Yes,I support programs that keep low-risk offenders out of jail and keep them as productive members of society. Diversion programs must be cost effective and cost-competitive.,Yes,"It's important to have recreation options in the city. The city council must ensure that current and future trails and bike lanes are properly placed, planned, maintained, and are affordable over the life of the asset."

Expanding our boundaries via annexation increases the associated cost of delivery of city services to these areas. While growth will continue in Billings, it needs to be sustainable and efficient and not be an excessive burden to taxpayers.",Yes,Discrimination in any form is unacceptable for our city.,Yes,We should continue to expand jail diversification programs in Billings. Drug court is a great example that has tremendous results. This will require that we continue to be open minded to new alternatives that can help to alleviate the burden on our jail and also serve those who are in need of assistance.,Yes,"We should continue to expand bike lanes and trails. The citizen survey clearly demonstrated that this is an important and valuable asset to our city. As the trail have expanded, there has been an increase in use."
